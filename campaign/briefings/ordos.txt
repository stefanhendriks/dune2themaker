House Ordos        
            
The home planet of the Ordos is a frigid and ice-covered world.
             
We presume the Ordos import their agricultural and technological goods from
nearby star systems.
Acting as traders and brokers, the Ordos produce no physical products but
instead rely upon their merchandising skills to make their profits.

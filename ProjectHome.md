This project attempts to be a dune 2 like 'clone' of Dune 2 - The Battle for Arrakis by Westwood Studios. Main goal is to play the original campaign of Dune 2, but also introduce new features like : skirmish and multiplayer mode; C&C like controls, etc.

## Roadmap ##
For a roadmap see [RoadMap](RoadMap.md).


## Used technology ##
Using the Allegro library (and some 3rd party libraries) this game is able to use features not standard delivered by the Allegro library itself. Features like:

- fast blending (fblend)
- mp3 playback (almp3)
- alfont (font drawing)

Windows Users:
Download the HOW-TO (see links at the right) to get to know how to get the source, 3rd party files, etc and get this thing compiling.

Linux Users:
Simply get yourself an SVN client (if you do not own one already) and do a checkout. a file 'howto.zip' is included where the instructions are how to compile the 3rd party libs under Linux. Thanks to T0th for making this possible.

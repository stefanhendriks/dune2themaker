=== Purpose ===

This page describes the design goals for the envisioned game “Dune2 – The Maker”.
This page will help shape the future direction the project will take and will be continuously updated to reflect decisions where the project will advance forward to.

 Note: _This document is currently a work in progres and you are encouraged to input and give comments regarding this work_.

=== Vision ===

_"I envision a game where I can choose to connect to a server from several freely maintained by players following a choice which side I would like to join. I decide to create my own side and take ownership of it allowing me to define a banner color._

_Following is a hard struggle to get enough spice to create a mini base with only a basic starting unit. I’m now in the main chat channels asking if anyone would like to join my side as I cannot do this on my own, I decide to change the name of my side. Someone requests to join and agrees to mine for spice while I continue defending the base and complete construction of a construction yard."_  -- Richard de Jong.

System Requirements
===================
The program has been tested on several systems; though it is timer based
the ideal is 30 fps or higher for a fluent gameplay overall. Windowed mode
is slower in general then full-screen. Most systems with just Windows would
run the program. 


===========
Description
===========

* Game that must be as close to DUNE 2 as possible, with some enhanced features, 
  but enormous nostalgic entertainment.

Features:
* 640x480 screen resolution
 - Bit depth is 16 or 32 bit, windowed mode = desktop bit depth, full screen = 16 bit.
* Smooth gameplay
  - C&C like controls
  - "point and click" gameplay
  - easy to use interface
* Double sized and enhanced dune 2 graphics:
  - sharp units/structures
  - real-shadows blending for units
  - enhanced terrain
  - enhanced shroud
  - drawn graphics resemble size of original dune 2 (so it looks 'big' , yes, but better)  
* Able to load any dune 2 scenario file
  - spice blooms
  - spice fields (determined in scenario file)
  - structures
  - units
  - player settings (credits, quota, etc)
  - reinforcements
* Able to show the strategy/campaign map, use similiar animations and has the same
  campaigns as in the original dune 2
* Uses the dune 2 tech-level tree
* Uses all original dune 2 (english) mission briefings
* Little animation 'system' for nice effects (fading, explosions, smoke, etc)
* Optimized, but still nostalgic, DUNE II GUI.



==================================
BALACING NOTES / UNIT DESCRIPTIONS
==================================
One of the things DUNE 2 lacked, was real balancing. Mostly you would win by just having bigger
better , and mostly, more units then your computer opponent. In D2TM this issue should be solved;
though I am not there yet, I do intent to get there!

In order to tackle this issue, a few things have been changed:

Troopers/Trooper:
-----------------
These units have big impact on units now. They can take out a tank/quad in a few shots. Though tanks
cannot kill any infantry with their massive firepower. Yet they do have effect on structures and other
units.

Infantry/Soldier:
-----------------
These units have little to no effect on bigger units, but they are the best weapon against the Trooper
and Troopers. Having no soldiers around your base, makes it a lot tougher to defend it. Even trikes
and Quads will have a more harder time to take out Trooper/Troopers then the Infantry/Soldier.


Quad/Trike/Raider:
------------------
These units are quick and have machineguns, so they are better against legged units. They can take out
any infantry (troopers, etc) quicker then any other tracked unit. In groups these units can be a 
massacre for any infantry legion.

Tank/Siege Tank:
----------------
With their massive brute force firepower, the tanks can take out any wheeled units without trouble.
They do have a lot of trouble with Troopers and the Trooper. A few Troopers take out tanks in no-time
so its not wise just to use these units.

Rocket Launcher:
----------------
Like in the original Dune 2. These units are devastating, when set on the right range towards their
target. It is not wise to use them against units who like to fire at close range. Once the target 
gets too near, the rockets will never hit their target and miss terribly. These units are perfect
for taking out bases quickly, especially turrets while your tanks distract the turrets firepower
from the Launcher.

Devastator/Sonic Tank:
----------------------
These units are accessible once you have built the House of IX and upgraded your Heavy Factory. 
The units deliver more firepower. The Devastator has more armor and is harder to destroy; yet it is 
a slow tank. When destroyed the Devastator will take any surrounding units/structures with it or
damage them horribly.

The Sonic Tank uses a sonic wave to attack its units. Effective against infantry and troopers! It
is fast but it lacks armor. Therefor it is easy to destroy.

Deviator:
---------
The Deviator acts like a normal Rocket Launcher. However, by firing its nerve gas it will convert
any unit to its own side. (Unline Dune 2, the units will STAY that way and not be converted back).
The unit is fast, light-weighted and has little armor; thus easily to destroy. However, do NOT
underestimate the power and danger of this unit!

- Fixed bug Repair Facility. (Units always repair as if they were totally damaged)
- Memory bug in loading INI file. (causing byte shifts, which *could* eventually screw things up)
- Able to select enemy units when pressing group number

CHANGED:
- "Devided" -> "Divided" 
- Unit drawing , more accurate on cells.
- Unit drawing , health bar and spice bar is different.

- Very smooth fading for Windtraps now (instead of using 256 color palette Blue values, it uses 16 bit values)
- Using some FBLEND routines for drawing transparant graphics and so on.
- "easy on cpu" auto-code. Will try to give cpu some slack if fps is above "ideal fps" (can be set). Especially useful on
  laptops.
- Skirmish mode, AI is primitive, but tough.
  - with totally new random map generator built in
  - able to create your own skirmish missions via INI files (up to 99 missions)
  - 4 players maximum (1 human, 3 CPU)
  - CPU can be Sardaukar
  * Able to see random created map by hovering mouse on the question mark. Default = invisible, so you can
    be really suprised to play (hit 'random map' and then 'play').

   *NOTE: Bug detected, starport does not function 100% yet.
* - Skirmish mode - maps are named as "map##.ini" , up to 99 maps supported.
- RakNet library is compiled in project and will assist in network code in future releases.
- MCV can be deployed with D now (select and press D).
- Carry-Alls blow sand/spice when picking up unit on sandy/spicy terrain.
- Structures graphics updates
  - Real shadow blending done
  - Structures show ground underneath, so if no fundament is built the building
    appears on rock, etc. 
- When infantry or troopers get 30% health; a single soldier/trooper appears
  with 100% health. The other 2 died (leaving bodies on the ground).

- Units can gain experience:
  - no stars = no experience
  - yellow stars (max 3)
  - orange stars (max 3)
  - red stars (max 3) -> max experience: twice damage done
  (*) Stars are gained by kills; infantry kills give units 2.5/10th star experience. 
      bigger units 4.5/10th star.  
  Units with more experience will deliver bigger hits on enemy units. 
- Tech Tree changes:
  - Repair Facility & High Tech is available from level 5 now.
  - Ordos WOR available at level 5.
- Force attack : Hold left control and click on cell to attack.
- Units & Structures blink when targetted, etc. 
- Rally points can be assigned to buildings. Select structure , hold left control and click on map.

- Force move   (ALT)
- Force attack (CTRL)

REMOVED:
- 32/16 bit adjustment in windowed mode. (speed increasement was minimal)

DEMO 3 - DEMO 2 (released at: 15/12/2006)
-----------------------------------------
BALANCING:

* In General:

- Infantry, Troopers, Trooper and Soldier are more of use now. Harder to kill, tougher in fights.
  NOTE: Do not take this to lightly , the above units where nearly useless in Dune 2, 
        in D2TM they are really functional!

- Quads and Trikes have a bit weaker anti-infantry guns now (though they are the best to kill infantry with)

- Special weapons are balanced more; deviator is not as dangerous as before, and can easily be
  killed. Though if used well, it can be a very usefull weapon as it turns units into yours
  for all time.

* Detailed:
- Trooper HP INCREASED from 45 to 80

- Troopers HP INCREASED from 110 to 140
- Troopers sight/range INCREASED from 4 to 5
- Troopers damage to vehicles INCREASED from 8 to 16
- Troopers Attackfrequency LOWERED from 25 to 18

- Soldier HP INCREASED from 20 to 80
- Infantry HP INCREASED from 50 to 150

- Quad damage to infantry(*) LOWERED from 12 to 8
- Quad attack frequency INCREASED from 10 to 12

- Trike damage to infantry LOWERED from 7 to 6

- Deviator chance to deviate lowered from 100% to 40%
- Deviator move speed LOWERED from 4 to 3 (means faster!)
- Deviator turn speed LOWERED from 4 to 3 (means faster!)
- Deviator HP DECREASED	from 110 to 70

(* Infantry=Troopers, Trooper, Soldier, Infantry)


FIXED:
- Several bugs in attack thinking, guard thinking of AI etc. AI units should be tougher
  to beat and also units behave more correctly. 
- Gun turrets damaging friendly structures.
- Several bugs concerning odd movement. (mostly after attacking)
- Now you will REALLY get a reinforcement when you have lost all harvesters, but you still have
  a refinery...
- Bug where ai would suddendly attack own unit or structure.
- Fixed a bug where walls turn into spice (by field= entries).
- Sandworm is now drawn ok (under units, not 'above' them).
- Devastator who would explode and damage surrounding units will not cause a stack overflow anymore.
- Fixed several bugs in moving code.
- Fixed 'harvester suddendly dissapearing'.
- Fixed 'shroud reveal' bug on up and left part of the screen.
  (When unit was moving upwards and visible , or going left and visible, the shroud would not
   be removed correctly when revealing parts that are not visible on screen).

CHANGED:
- Upgraded concrete slabs can be placed even when red squares appear. The only exception is you
  cannot build them out of range (ie, not bordered to another concrete or friendly structure)
- Some unit graphics are upgraded, thanks to Nema Fakei.
  - Combat Tank
  - Launcher
  - Siege Tank
  - Sonic Tank
- Better removal of unit data on map (faster, more effecient).
- Logging of pathfinder in log.txt
- Harvesters prioritize spice hills above normal spice now. 
 
NEW:
- DEBUG mode EXE file delivered.
- Low power means:
  - twice as slow building
- Spice blooms are generated 'instantly'. There is a minimum requirement of 3 spiceblooms a map.
- Compile date and time are now in log.txt (check this to be sure to have the latest
  version if you are not sure).
- Damage done by units/structures is now House depended:
  - Ordos do at least 80% damage
  - Harkonnen do 120% damage
  - Atreides = 100% for everything
  (as you may have noticed, moving , harvesting, dumping etc is already House
   dependant. So is Ordos quicker with moving, dumping and harvesting)
- Return harvester to refinery: Select harvester, press D. (from Dump/Deploy spice)
- Ornithopters work now. Swift attacks of 2 rockets. However, in order to be taken down
  the Rocket Turrets are able to shoot "homing missiles" which will track down the ornithopters
  for an amount of time. Units are able to damage the ornithopter mostly with luck.
- Rocket Turrets will now shoot 'bullets' when target gets too close.
- Rocket Turrets have priorities now in targets
  - Aircraft (ornithopters) , high priority
  - Enemy ground units, normal priority
  - Sandworms, lowest priority
  EXAMPLE: When the enemy attacks with aircraft & enemy units. The aircraft is the target
           , then the ground units.
- Worm leaves now a trail of 'distorted sand'. 
- When insufficient concrete is built beneath a structure, the structure will damage easily 
  through time and will require frequent repairs. Eventually it will stop at 50% damage.
  AI will react to this and repair at 75% damage.
- Clock-wise progress indicator is now 32 frames instead of 16, more fluently and only
  on ICON-picture (not text).
- Repair facility works. Hold R and hover above units to order them to repair. They will be
  picked up by Carry-Alls automaticly if available. They will be brought to the nearest
  available repair facility.

AI SPECIFIC:
- AI will build more harvesters, and will rebuild harvesters when eaten or destroyed to keep
  harvester/refinery ratio 1/1. If possible, it will try to build the ratio as 2/1
- AI will build carry-alls.
- AI will build ornithopters
- AI will use repair facilities for damaged vehicles.
- AI will blow up spice blooms by walking over them with light infantry or troopers.


DEMO 2 - DEMO 1 (released at: 05/02/2006)
-----------------------------------------
FIXED:
- Palette bug when going from mission to mentat again. (Atreides book was blue
  etc).
- Loading a new scenario will remove now the old icon list and refresh it (ie, you 
  can no longer build advanced stuff in a new mission. The tech-tree is restarted)
- Ability to attack non-visible units/structures.
- Ability to build WOR sometimes as Atreides/Ordos

CHANGED:
- Scrolling is now timer based, not fps based. 
- Scrolling is now also possible when placing a structure.
- Health bar of units do not stay on the top.
- Mentat speaking animations will now not 'hang' for too long.
- Mentat speaking is a bit faster
- UI in game is changed with new graphics from Nema Fakei
- Win and lose 'announcement' changed.
- Build speed is now set to normal
- All Houses Mission 9 changed, quota's where set to win mission. Seems to me like
  a lack of finishing things from Westwood earlier and made it work code-wise. Its
  sloppy so i removed the quota= lines to make it work properly.

NEW:
- When hovering over unit, mouse turns into "select" picture
- When units selected, moving over other friendly units will now make it possible to
  select them.
- As an addition, holding SHIFT, will ADD the units to the already selected group!
- Smoothly fading between several sections in menu/briefing/combat
- Rewritten "hover over unit" detection. (single unit detection only)
- Original Atreides briefings (all missions)
- "Select your next conquest" screen introduced. Including campaign support!
- Campaign can be edited through the ini files in "campaign" directory
- All house mission briefing/win/lose/advice are added, thanks to:
  - Gilneas -> Harkonnen
  - Josh -> Atreides
  - MrFlibble -> Ordos
- House briefings and mission briefings now through "mentatx.ini"
- You can fail your mission.
- When enemy unit revealed, or when enemy unit is getting too close the music changes
  and you will hear "enemy unit approaching".
- Turrets work now, so watch your units!
- Ability to create groups: CTRL-1/5 to create. Press 1/5 to select. Hold SHIFT + <number>
  to add group to selection.
- Sound effects are distance related. Everything on screen = 100% sound volume. The further
  away from the sound-origin, the less volume the sound has. No panning though.
- Enemy structures repair now when damaged:
  - When AI has a lot of money, they instant repair on a bit damage
  - When AI does not have a lot of money, repair starts at 50% damage
- Sandworms will be attacked , but units will not chase them.
- Thanks to MrFlibble, all Ordos Seed files are now revealed! All missions work now properly!
- Pathfinder optimized; not speed wize but work-wise. The path generator will now not have
  odd corners and twists, but a real fast-path calculation. Bloody sandworms forced me to 
  work on this one.
- When all harvesters gone and still having a refinery; automaticly harvester being reinforced
  to ensure some income. (For the player & AI)
- Simple AI opponent; which will build an army and create groups of units to attack you.
  Has exactly the same build-speeds; money income flow (no unlimited money!). Can only
  Attack what it can see.
- Reinforcements; loaded from INI file, and works like Dune 2. 

REMOVED:
- GIF support files, since using own DAT format

KNOWN 'BUGS':
- There is still no "Select your house < name >". The < name > is missing. 
- Harvester is not 100% yet controllable; ie, you cannot send it to the refinery.
- The repair facility does not function
- The ornithopter does not attack

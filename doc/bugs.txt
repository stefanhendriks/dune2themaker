Found bugs:

TODO:
===================================

BUGS:
-Harvester doesn't enter refinery after pressing 'D'. 
It drives back to the refinery but when it should enter the building the 
harvester turns around and continues to harvest till it's 100% full. 
(the refinery lights keep flashing after the harvester goes back harvesting)


-skirmish: CPU doesn't use concrete for buildings

-Vehicles can exit the map.
All borders? Or only the right/bottom?


-combat tank has very high rate of fire
-tanks can't enter the repair fac. by land
-gun turret overpowered?

Some big and small bugs I've discovered during a 1v1 skirmish game:

-Units can exit the map on the left border as well. So every border of the playfield are opened in the demo.

-The amount of tanks which can be ordered at the Starport seems to depend on how much money you have instead of how many tanks are in stock at the Starport.

-sometimes harvesters just teleport away from a spicefield. They also teleport from the refinery to the spicefields sometimes.

-radarscreen isn't perfectly aligned in the hud

-When a carryall (carrying a unit) is hovering above an area where you want to place 4 concrete slabs, the square where the carryall is at the moment won't have a slab.

-Repairfacility still has some bugs. I've just played another skirmish game and I had to use the repairbutton on a Siegetank 5 times before a carryall dropped it into the facility. The other 4 times the tank as picked up, the carryall hovered above the R.F. but dropped the tank next to it.


STILL NOT FIXED! :(
- Sandworm: it kills infantry when it's beneath infantry without eating them. (it wasn't like this in the original)

NEW:
-stop button for units.
-a sell button
-special weapons (saboteur, dead hand, fremen) aren't available in the Palace.


DONE:
===================================
BUGS FIXED:
- Instead, if I were to click on the Upgrade button again, the upgrade is completed INSTANTLY.
- Sandorm able to squish infantry when going under infantry.
- It is no longer possible to select airborn units with box-selecting.
- animation fixes for structures (WOR/Barracks stopped animating after building unit)
- animaiton fix for outpost
- box selecting problem (needed to cover entire unit). Now only the center is required to select a unit.

GAME BALANCING:
- Harvester has more HP (300->450)
- Troopers are made less effective

NEW ADDED:
- Dune 2 Seed map generator. Thanks to jpexs for completing the generator and making this possible!
- "game" switch to load own ini file (ie, use d2tm.exe -game myinifile.ini)
- A few skirmish maps to play with

CHANGED:
- skirmish maps do not need to be MAP##.ini anymore, they can be named anything
- Units are a bit more aggresive in 'defense' mode (for both AI as Human player)

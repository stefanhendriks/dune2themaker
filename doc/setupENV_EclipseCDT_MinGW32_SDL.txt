Installing Eclipse
==================

Once you have downloaded Eclipse, all you need to do is unpack it into a sensible directory and then run the application. You will need a JRE installed in order for Eclipse to run. If you are using Linux it should find all your compilers and tools; if you are using Windows is should find MinGW as long as it is installed

Installing SDL
==============

This step differs depending on your operating system

On Linux, Unix and variants, you will need to install libsdl-dev package for whatever distribution you are using
On Windows, you will need to extract the development package from www.libsdl.org into your MinGW folder, 
so that the files from 'bin' in the archive go to MinGW/bin and so on. Setting up your Eclipse project for SDL

Once you have created a new project using the Eclipse new project dialog (either C or C++), you will to add SDL 
support to the project. In the SDL documentation, you will see reference to an 'sdl-config' script. 
Unfortunately the limited shell capabilities of Windows mean that we have to put this info in manually. 

Open up the Project->Properties menu.

Go into the C/C++ Build -> Settings page

In the Compiler->Preprocessor section, add the defined symbol "main=SDL_main"
In the Linker->Libraries section, add the libraries "mingw32" (Windows only), "SDLmain" and "SDL" libraries (in that order).
In the Linker->Miscellaneous section, add "-mwindows" to the Linker Flags box (Windows only)

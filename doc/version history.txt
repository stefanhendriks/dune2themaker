===================
System Requirements
===================
The program has been tested on several systems; though it is timer based
the ideal is 30 fps or higher for a fluent gameplay overall. Windowed mode
is slower in general then full-screen. Most systems with just Windows would
run the program. 

There are good experiences running this game within Wine on Linux. Those who
do not use Windows, but still want to try out the game, you could give Wine
a shot.

==================================
BALACING NOTES / UNIT DESCRIPTIONS
==================================
One of the things DUNE 2 lacked, was real balancing. Mostly you would win by just having bigger
better , and mostly, more units then your computer opponent. In D2TM this issue should be solved;
though I am not there yet, I do intent to get there!

In order to tackle this issue, a few things have been changed:

Troopers/Trooper:
-----------------
These units have big impact on units now. They can take out a tank/quad in a few shots. Though tanks
cannot kill any infantry with their massive firepower. Yet they do have effect on structures and other
units.

Infantry/Soldier:
-----------------
These units have little to no effect on bigger units, but they are the best weapon against the Trooper
and Troopers. Having no soldiers around your base, makes it a lot tougher to defend it. Even trikes
and Quads will have a more harder time to take out Trooper/Troopers then the Infantry/Soldier.


Quad/Trike/Raider:
------------------
These units are quick and have machineguns, so they are better against legged units. They can take out
any infantry (troopers, etc) quicker then any other tracked unit. In groups these units can be a 
massacre for any infantry legion.

Tank/Siege Tank:
----------------
With their massive brute force firepower, the tanks can take out any wheeled units without trouble.
They do have a lot of trouble with Troopers and the Trooper. A few Troopers take out tanks in no-time
so its not wise just to use these units.

Rocket Launcher:
----------------
Like in the original Dune 2. These units are devastating, when set on the right range towards their
target. It is not wise to use them against units who like to fire at close range. Once the target 
gets too near, the rockets will never hit their target and miss terribly. These units are perfect
for taking out bases quickly, especially turrets while your tanks distract the turrets firepower
from the Launcher.

Devastator/Sonic Tank:
----------------------
These units are accessible once you have built the House of IX and upgraded your Heavy Factory. 
The units deliver more firepower. The Devastator has more armor and is harder to destroy; yet it is 
a slow tank. When destroyed the Devastator will take any surrounding units/structures with it or
damage them horribly.

The Sonic Tank uses a sonic wave to attack its units. Effective against infantry and troopers! It
is fast but it lacks armor. Therefor it is easy to destroy.

Deviator:
---------
The Deviator acts like a normal Rocket Launcher. However, by firing its nerve gas it will convert
any unit to its own side. (Unline Dune 2, the units will STAY that way and not be converted back).
The unit is fast, light-weighted and has little armor; thus easily to destroy. However, do NOT
underestimate the power and danger of this unit!

==========
TO-DO LIST
==========
* Make tech-tree 100% accurate
* Balance game more (game.ini)
* Mentat for 'advice' and unit descriptions
* Eventually clean up code (source code is available at google code)

New features:
* Skirmish (<- working on this)
* Multiplayer
* Options
* Save/Load game

==========
CHANGELOG:
==========
A lot has changed 'under the hood'. This means that on the surface, you will not notice
the hard work put into this release. Expectation is that next releases will get more new
features and less fixes.

FIXED:
- Instantly upgrade complete bug fixed. (completely rewritten)
- Sandorm able to squish infantry when going under infantry.
- It is no longer possible to select airborn units with box-selecting.
- animation fixes for structures (WOR/Barracks stopped animating after building unit)
- animation fix for outpost
- box selecting problem (needed to cover entire unit). Now only the center is required to select a unit.
- Bug that would give higher/lower refund when declining order for starport (completely rewritten) 

GAME BALANCING:
- Harvester has more HP (300->450)
- Troopers are made less effective

NEW:
- Dune 2 Seed map generator. Thanks to jpexs for completing the generator and making this possible!
- "game" switch to load own ini file (ie, use d2tm.exe -game myinifile.ini)
- 8 new skirmish maps

CHANGED:
- skirmish maps do not need to be MAP##.ini anymore, they can be named anything
- Units are a bit more aggresive in 'defense' mode (for both AI as Human player)
- the way sound is played in the game is rewritten, which allows more sounds to be played
  at once
- money gain/drain animation

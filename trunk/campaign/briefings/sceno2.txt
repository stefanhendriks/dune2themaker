It seems the Emperor has a bigger plan for all participating Houses on Dune.
The motives are unsure. We are to weak to take matters in our own hands.
Mine 2700 credits worth of spice. That should be sufficient for our investment
in Dune and to pay off the Emperor to keep him off our backs. 
A Harkonnen base is detected by our intelligence, advice is to concentrate on
the spice and avoid enemy contact.

I am Radnor. If you do well we might conquer this 
dusty little planet together. It will suit our needs perfectly.
Your first mission requires you to mine 1000 credits worth of spice.
         
Build a windtrap and a refinery. Do not care about repairs, only about
the money.
Any resistance in this mission will be crushed. Failure is not an option.

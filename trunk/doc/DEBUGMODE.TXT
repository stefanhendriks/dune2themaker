DEBUG MODE:
This version includes a D2TM - DEBUG.EXE file. This will enable D2TM into
debugging mode to spit out a lot of information into log.txt 

You can use this to see how the pathfinder works, but mostly to track down bugs.

Use TAB-D to see unit/structure ID's and information. Use SHIFT-F4 to destroy
instantly a unit and so on. The DEBUG version has less eye-candy and can run a
bit 'stuttery' due the fact it writes to disk more then the original d2tm exe files.

When launching the D2TM - DEBUG.EXE file you will see the word "DEBUG" on main
screen and you will see the game has a raster of cells, no fancy shroud and paths
drawn for pathfinding. 

If you find a bug and you want to replicate it or get more info about this try:
- run with "d2tm - debug.exe"
- get the unit ID (so you know what to look for later), by pressing TAB-D
- use te unit to replicate the bug, or wait until the bug seems to happen, you can
  quickly jump to missions where nescesary (see controls.txt)
- when the bug occurs, wait a bit and quit the game (ESC)
- open up LOG.TXT and try to find the unit , you can search by its name and 
  an ID will be shown:

Example:
  [UNIT[8]: Raider Trike - House 3, iCell = 2207, iGoal = 2207 ] 'ORDERED TO MOVE'

Shortly:

  [UNIT[ # ID ] : <name > - House <ID> , iCell = <current cell>, iGoal = <current goal cell> ] 

  and a message between ' ' telling some more about its behaviour or messages.

Typcally when a unit is ordered to move, you will see: 

  [UNIT[8]: Raider Trike - House 3, iCell = 2207, iGoal = 2207 ] 'ORDERED TO MOVE'
  [UNIT[8]: Raider Trike - House 3, iCell = 2207, iGoal = 2527 ] 'No pathindex & no nextcell, resetting unit'
  [UNIT[8]: Raider Trike - House 3, iCell = 2207, iGoal = 2527 ] 'Create path ... result = 0'

DEBUG mode is only available in DEMO 3 , perhaps in DEMO 4. The question is how much
use it will be for a user / player to use this debug version to track down bugs. If 
anyone seriously wants to playtest any latest version, contact me at stefanhen83@planet.nl
